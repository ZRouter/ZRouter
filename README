Two ways to build zrouter.org:

FIRST WAY RUN menu.sh

sh menu.sh

It will display menu:

Device		Select the target device

* Device		Select the target device
Here you can select device for which to build firmware

* BaseProfile	Select base profile
Select base profile, which have basic set of tools (init, sh, ls, etc.) to
start box.

* Profiles	Select profiles to build
Additional profiles, like firewall you want (ipfw or pf), IPSec tools, ppp or
mpd to be able connect to 3G networks, ISP with PPPoE service, etc.

* Paths		Set the paths of sources and build objects
Since so many items still not in FreeBSD source tree, we need to use own tree,
so here you need to set path to it tree copy.

* Save		Save build profile
Save things that you already configure with this menu.

* Load		Load build profile
Load previously configured and saved variables.

* Build		Build ZRouter !
Run ZRouter.org build.


SECOND WAY RUN make

make TARGET_PAIR=D-Link/DIR-615-E4 FREEBSD_SRC_TREE=${FREEBSD_SRC_TREE}

replace ${FREEBSD_SRC_TREE} with path to ZRouter.org copy of FreeBSD tree.
replace D-Link/DIR-615-E4 with device for which you want to build FirmWare.
List of devices you can get by:
make
