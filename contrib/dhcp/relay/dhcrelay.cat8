       The Internet Software Consortium DHCP Relay Agent, dhcrelay, provides a
       means  for  relaying  DHCP and BOOTP requests from a subnet to which no
       DHCP server is directly connected to one or more DHCP servers on  other
       subnets.

OOPPEERRAATTIIOONN
       The  DHCP  Relay  Agent  listens  for  DHCP  requests on all interfaces
       attached to a host, unless one or more interfaces are specified on  the
       command line with the _‐_i flag.

       When  a  query  is  received,  dhcrelay forwards it to the list of DHCP
       servers specified on the command line.   When a reply is  received,  it
       is broadcast or unicast on the network from whence the original request
       came.

       It is possible to specify a set of interfaces on  which  dhcrelay  will
       listen,  so  that  if  dhcrelay is connected through one interface to a
       network on which there is no DHCP server, but is connected  on  another
       interface  to  a  network  on which there is a DHCP server, it will not
       relay DHCP and BOOTP requests from the  network  on  which  the  server
       exists to that server.   This is an imperfect solution.

       The  names  of  the  network interfaces that dhcrelay should attempt to
       configure may be specified on the command line using the _‐_i option.  If
       no  interface  names  are  specified  on the command line dhcrelay will
       identify all network interfaces, elimininating non‐broadcast interfaces
       if possible, and attempt to configure each interface.

       If  dhcrelay  should listen and transmit on a port other than the stan‐
       dard (port 67), the ‐‐pp flag may used.  It should be followed by the udp
       port number that dhcrelay should use.  This is mostly useful for debug‐
       ging purposes.  If the ‐‐pp flag  is  specified,  the  relay  agent  will
       transmit responses to clients at a port number that is one greater than
       the one specified ‐ i.e., if you specify ‐‐pp 67, then  the  relay  agent
       will  listen  on  port  67  and transmit to port 68.   Transmissions to
       servers will be sent to the same port number that it specified  in  the
       ‐‐pp flag.

       Dhcrelay will normally run in the foreground until it has configured an
       interface, and then will revert to running in the background.   To  run
       force  dhcrelay  to  always  run  as  a foreground process, the ‐‐dd flag
       should be specified.  This is useful  when  running  dhcrelay  under  a
       debugger, or when running it out of inittab on System V systems.

       Dhcrelay  will  normally  print  its  network configuration on startup.
       This can be annoying in a system startup script ‐ to disable  this  be‐
       haviour, specify the _‐_q flag.

       The  name  of at least one DHCP server to which DHCP and BOOTP requests
       should be relayed must be specified on the command line.
