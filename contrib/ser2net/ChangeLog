	from 0 to 100.  Best guess on what this should be, as the

	"sys/ioctl.h".

2005-10-20  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Fixed a problem with rfc2217 stop bit size setting.
	It was interpreting the value of "3" as 2 stop bits, but 3 is for
	1.5 stop bits, and 2 is for 2 stop bits.

	* controller.c: Fixed some warnings dealing with char/unsigned
	char problems.
	* dataxfer.c: ditto
	* telnet.c: ditto

2005-08-25  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

2003-12-20  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c, ser2net.8: Added the ability to have port 0 mean use

	* devcfg.h, devcfg.c, controller.c, dataxfer.c, dataxfer.h, ser2net.8:
	Ben Adams sent a patch to control the DTR and RTS lines, I rewrote

	* ser2net.spec - Added this file for RPM building, from Ivan
