  ser2net now supports RFC 2217, the ability to control the serial
  port with telnet options.  So, for instance, you can connect to a
  ser2net session with a client that has this option and control
  the baud rate, stopbits, parity, etc.  The only client I know of
  that supports this is c-kermit, available at
  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit
