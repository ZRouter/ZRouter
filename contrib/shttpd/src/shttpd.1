.Nd lightweight web server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Op Ar config_file
.Nm
.Fl A Ar htpasswd_file domain_name user_name password
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is small, fast and easy to use web server with CGI, SSL, Digest Authorization
support. It can be run as stand-alone server, be managed by
.Xr inetd 8
, or be embedded into existing C/C++ application.
.Pp
.Nm
does not detach from terminal, and makes current working directory
be the web root, unless
.Fl root
option is specified.
.Pp
Unlike other web servers,
.Nm
does not expect CGI scirpts to be put in a special directory. They may be
anywhere. CGI files are recognized by the file extension.
.Pp
SSI files are also recognized by extension. Currently, the only SSI directives
supported are `<!--#include "url-encoded-path" -->'
and `<!--#exec "program" -->'. The `url-encoded-path' can be relative to
.Nm
working directory, or absolute system path. In the embedded mode, more
directives are available: #call, #if/#elif/#endif/#else/#endif.
Unsupported SSI directives are silently ignored.
.Pp
It is possible to specify multiple ports to listen on. For example, to
make
.Nm
listen on HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443, one should start it as
.Sq shttpd -ssl_cert cert.pem -ports 80,443s
.Pp
.Nm
can use the configuration file. By default, it is "shttpd.conf", and if it
is present in the same directory where
.Nm
lives, the command line options are read from it. Alternatively, the
configuration file may be specified as a last argument. The format of the
configuration file is exactly the same as for the command line options, the
only difference is that the command line options must be specified on
separate lines, and leading dashes for option names must be omitted.
Lines beginning with '#' are regarded as comments and ignored.

.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A Ar htpasswd_file domain_name user_name password

.It Fl acl Ar (+|-)x.x.x.x[/x],...
Specify access control list (ACL). ACL is a comma separated list
of IP subnets, each subnet is prepended by '-' or '+' sign. Plus means allow,
minus means deny. If subnet mask is
omitted, like "-1.2.3.4", then it means single IP address. Mask may vary
from 0 to 32 inclusive. Default: not set, allow all.
.It Fl aliases Ar list
This options gives an ability to serve the directories outside web root
by sort of symbolic linking to certain URI. The
.Ar list
must be comma-separated list of URI=PATH pairs, like this:
"/etc/=/my_etc,/tmp=/my_tmp". Default: not set.
.It Fl auth_PUT Ar file
PUT and DELETE passwords file. This must be specified if PUT or
DELETE methods are used. Default: not set.
.It Fl auth_gpass Ar file
Location of global passwords file. When set, per-directory .htpasswd files are
ignored, and all accessed must be authorised against global passwords file.
Default: not set.
.It Fl auth_realm Ar domain_name
Authorization realm. Default: "mydomain.com".
.It Fl cfg_uri Ar uri
If set,
.Nm
creates special administrative URI where options may be changed at runtime.
This URI probably wants to be password-protected, look at
.Fl protect
option, and in the EXAMPLES section on how to do it. Default: not set.
.It Fl cgi_env Ar list
Pass environment variables to the CGI script in addition to standard ones.
The list must be comma-separated list of X=Y pairs, like this:
"VARIABLE1=VALUE1,VARIABLE2=VALUE2".  Default: not set.
.It Fl cgi_ext Ar list
Comma-separated list of CGI extensions.  All files having these extensions
are treated as CGI scripts. Default: "cgi,pl,php"
.It Fl cgi_interp Ar file
Force
.Ar file
to be a CGI interpreter for all CGI scripts. By default this option is not
set, and
.Nm
decides which interpreter to use by looking at the first line of CGI script.
.It Fl dir_list Ar yes|no
Enable/disable directory listing. Default: "1" (enabled).
.It Fl error_log Ar file
Error log file. Default: not set, no errors are logged.
.It Fl inetd Ar yes|no
Enable/disable inetd mode. Default: "0" (disabled).
.It Fl mime_types Ar list
Additional to builtin mime types, in form "EXTENSION1=TYPE1,EXTENSION2=TYPE2".
.It Fl ports Ar port_list
Comma-separated list of ports to listen on. If the port is SSL, a letter 's'
must be appeneded, for example, "80,443s" will open port 80 and port 443,
and connections on port 443 will be SSL-ed. Default: 80
.It Fl protect Ar list
Comma separated list of URI=PATH pairs, specifying that given URIs
must the protected with respected password files. Default: not set.
.It Fl root Ar directory
Location of the WWW root directory. Default: working directory from which
.Nm
has been started.
.It Fl ssi_ext Ar list
Comma separated list of SSI extensions. Default: "shtml,shtm".
.It Fl ssl_cert Ar pem_file
Location of SSL certificate file. Default: not set.
.It Fl systray Ar yes|no
Hide console and put an icon on system tray (Windows only). Default: no.

.Sh EMBEDDING
.Nm
can be built as a library to embed web server functionality
into C/C++ application. The API functions are declared in a header
file
.Pa shttpd.h .
Please refer to the source package for a header file and the examples.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Nm Fl root Ar /var/www Fl ports Ar 8080,8043s Fl ssl_cert Ar /etc/cert.pem Fl aliases Ar /aa=/tmp,/bb=/etc
Start listening on port 8080 for HTTP, and 8043 for HTTPS connections.
Use /etc/cert.pem as SSL certificate file. Web root is /var/www. In addition,
map directory /tmp to URI /aa, directory /etc to URI /bb.
.It Nm Fl acl Ar -0.0.0.0/0,+10.0.0.0/8,+1.2.3.4
Deny connections from everywhere, allow only IP address 1.2.3.4 and
all IP addresses from 10.0.0.0/8 subnet to connect.
.It Nm Fl ports Ar 8080 Fl cfg_uri Ar /ctl Fl protect Ar /ctl=/tmp/passwords.txt
Start listening on port 8080, create an administrative URI "/ctl" where
options may be changed at runtime, and protect that URI with authorization.
