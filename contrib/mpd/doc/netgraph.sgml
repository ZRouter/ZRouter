  <sect><heading>Netgraph device type commands<label id="netgraph"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to netgraph type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>ng</bf>.

  Note that this device type has no direct way to detect a physical layer
  disconnection (i.e., what would be analogous to loss of carrier detect)
  except by receiving a write error. One way to achieve this is to
  insure that when the physical layer goes down, the connection to
  the Netgraph hook is broken.

<tag><tt>
set ng node <em>nodepath</em>
</tt></tag>

<tag><tt>
set ng hook <em>hook</em>
</tt></tag>

These commands configure which Netgraph node, and which hook on that
node, mpd is supposed to connect to. The node is found via the
absolute Negraph address <tt><em>nodepath</em></tt> and must have
a free hook named <tt><em>hook</em></tt>. Both of these commands
are required.

The hook should be connectable directly to a link hook of the
<tt>ng_ppp(3)</tt> netgraph node type.  That is, it should be
prepared to transmit and receive PPP frames starting with the
address and control fields (unless compressed), followed by the
PPP protocol number and information fields, but containing no
checksum field.
