  <sect><heading>IPCP layer<label id="ipcp"></heading>

<p>

  This chapter describes commands that configure the IP Control
  Protocol (IPCP) layer. To enable IPCP, <tt>ipcp</tt> option should be
  enabled at the bundle layer. All of these commands apply to the currently
  active bundle.

<tag><tt>
set ipcp ranges (<em>local/width</em>|ippool <em>pool</em>) (<em>remote/width</em>|ippool <em>pool</em>)
</tt></tag>

This command determines what IP addresses mpd will allow to be
negotiated at the local and remote ends of the link. For each
endpoint, we have a target address and a netmask width.  The
<tt><em>width</em></tt> determines how flexible we are, i.e., how
close the actual negotiated address must be to the target address.
A <tt><em>width</em></tt> of 32 means they must match exactly; a
<tt><em>width</em></tt> of zero means any address is suitable. For
example, <tt>192.168.1.17/25</tt> means that IP address
<tt>192.168.1.17</tt> is desired, but any IP address in the range
<tt>192.168.1.0</tt> through <tt>192.168.1.128</tt> is acceptable.

By convention, the <tt><em>local</em></tt> address may be
<tt>0.0.0.0</tt> to request that the remote server assign us an IP
address. Of course, for this to work the remote side must know
<em>a priori</em> what our local IP address should be.

The <tt><em>remote</em></tt> address should <em>not</em> be
<tt>0.0.0.0</tt>. This is so if the peer requests <tt>0.0.0.0</tt>,
we have some address to give him.  The <tt><em>width</em></tt> may
of course be zero.

It is also possible to specify ippool name to use for assigning remote ip.
In such case width 32 is assumed.

If the two sides cannot agree on the IP address assignments after
repeated negotiation attempts, then the connection will fail. This
is manifested with the error message ``IPCP: not converging.''

<tag><tt>
set ipcp dns <em>primary</em> [ <em>secondary</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Some PPP clients request DNS server information from their remote peer.
This commands enables mpd to have an answer for any such clients.
This command is especially useful for supplying information to PPTP clients.
One or two DNS server IP addresses may be given. An address of
<tt>0.0.0.0</tt> erases that entry.

<tag><tt>
set ipcp nbns <em>primary</em> [ <em>secondary</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Some MIcrosoft PPP clients request NetBIOS name server (NBNS)
information from their remote peer.  This commands enables mpd to
have an answer for any such clients.  This command is especially
useful for supplying information to PPTP clients.  One or two NBNS
server IP addresses may be given. An address of <tt>0.0.0.0</tt>
erases that entry.

<tag><tt>set ipcp accept <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set ipcp deny <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set ipcp enable <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set ipcp disable <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set ipcp yes <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set ipcp no <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>

These commands configure various IPCP options. The <tt><bf>vjcomp</bf></tt>
option is <em>bi-directional</em> in that it can be independently
enabled and disabled in each direction.

The <tt><bf>enable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>disable</bf></tt> commands determine
whether we want the corresponding option.
The <tt><bf>accept</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>deny</bf></tt> commands determine
whether we will allow the peer to request the corresponding option.

<p>
The <bf><tt>yes</tt></bf> command is the same as
<tt><bf>enable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>accept</bf></tt>.
The <bf><tt>no</tt></bf> command is the same as
<tt><bf>disable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>deny</bf></tt>.

<p>
The options available at the IPCP layer are:

<descrip>

<tag><tt>vjcomp</tt></tag>

This option enables Van Jacobson TCP header compression, which saves
several bytes per TCP data packet. You almost always want this option.
This compression ineffective for TCP connections with enabled modern 
extensions like time stamping or SACK, which modify TCP options between 
sequential packets.

Default <tt><bf>enable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>accept</bf></tt>.

<tag><tt>req-pri-dns </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>req-sec-dns </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>req-pri-nbns </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>req-sec-nbns </tt></tag><p>

Enabling these options causes mpd to request primary and/or secondary
DNS and/or NBNS servers from the remote peer during negotiation.

If any DNS servers are supplied by the peer, they will appear as
parameters to the script specified by the <tt>set iface up-script</tt>
command, if any.

Currently, mpd does not use the NBNS values for anything; they just
appear in the log. A future revision may actually do something with them.
