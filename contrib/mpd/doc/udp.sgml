  <sect><heading>UDP device type commands<label id="udp"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to UDP type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>udp</bf>.

  <p>
  It is suggested that the <tt>set iface mtu</tt> command be used
  when this link type is in use to avoid IP fragmentation if you want
  to get something better channel utilization.

  <p>
  <bf>Note:</bf> Technically this device type is not completely correct, 
  because PPP links are not allowed to re-order frames, yet UDP packets can
  be delivered out of order. Therefore, if you use this link type you
  should not enable multi-link PPP, PPP encryption, or PPP compression.
  Otherwise, out of order frames will be dropped, leading to performance
  degradation.

<tag><tt>
set udp self <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the local IP address and port for the UDP connection.
If none is specified, any suitable local IP address is used.
Port specification is required for incoming connection accepting.

<tag><tt>
set udp peer <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the peer IP address and port for the UDP connection.
Address and port specification is required for connection originating.
For incoming connections it is not required, but can limit who can connect to us.

</descrip>

<p>
The following options are supported:

<descrip>

<tag><tt>resolve-once</tt></tag>

Enables resolving peer address only once, on startup, or on manual
typing in CLI.

The default is enable.

</descrip>
