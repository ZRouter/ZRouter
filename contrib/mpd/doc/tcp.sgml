  <sect><heading>TCP device type commands<label id="tcp"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to TCP type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>tcp</bf>.
  <p>
  Due to limitations of ng_ksocket module this device type have two issues:
  <itemize>
  <item>when there are no free incoming link, new connection will anyway 
    be acceped and then dropped instead of not accepting it,
  <item>tcp connection status is not monitored, so you should use 
    'set link keep-alive' to detect broken links.
  </itemize>

<descrip>

<tag><tt>
set tcp self <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the local IP address and port for the TCP connection.
Port field is required for accepting incoming connections.

<tag><tt>
set tcp peer <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the peer IP address and port for the TCP connection.
Address and port fields are required for outgoing connections.
For incoming connections it is not required, but can limit who can connect to us.
