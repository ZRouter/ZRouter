<p>

  This chapter describes commands that configure the bundle layer.
  All of these commands (except <bf><tt>new</tt></bf>)
  apply to the currently active bundle, i.e.,
  the bundle shown at the command line prompt.

<descrip>

<tag><tt>
set bundle period <em>seconds</em>
<newline>set bundle hiwat <em>percent</em>
<newline>set bundle lowat <em>percent</em>
<newline>set bundle min-con <em>seconds</em>
<newline>set bundle min-dis <em>seconds</em>
<newline>set bundle links <em>link1</em> [ <em>...</em> ]
</tt></tag>

These commands are only meaningful when bandwidth management is enabled.
Mpd will attempt to bring up a new link from the list specified 
or take down an existing link when the utilization goes above
<tt><em>hiwat</em></tt> or below <tt><em>lowat</em></tt> percent,
respectively. The utilization is sampled every <tt><em>period</em></tt>
divided by 6 points, and is averaged over the past <tt><em>period</em></tt> seconds.

Mpd will not attempt to disconnect a link unless previous one was 
disconnected at least <tt><em>min-dis</em></tt> seconds before. 
Similarly, mpd will not open a link unless previous was opened at least
<tt><em>min-con</em></tt> seconds before. These two parameters
help prevent oscillations, but cause slower response time.

<tag><tt>
set bundle fsm-timeout <em>seconds</em>
</tt></tag>

This sets the finite state machine (FSM) retry interval for all
FSM's on this bundle. This command should only be used in exceptional
situations, such as doing PPP over high-latency satellite links.
The default is 2 seconds. 

<tag><tt>
set bundle accept <em>option ...</em>
<newline>set bundle deny <em>option ...</em>
<newline>set bundle enable <em>option ...</em>
<newline>set bundle disable <em>option ...</em>
<newline>set bundle yes <em>option ...</em>
<newline>set bundle no <em>option ...</em>
</tt></tag>

These commands configure various bundle options. Most options 
are <em>bi-directional</em> in that they can be independently
enabled and disabled in each direction.

<p>
The <tt><bf>enable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>disable</bf></tt> commands determine
whether we want the corresponding option.
The <tt><bf>accept</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>deny</bf></tt> commands determine
whether we will allow the peer to request the corresponding option.

<p>
The <bf><tt>yes</tt></bf> command is the same as
<tt><bf>enable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>accept</bf></tt>.
The <bf><tt>no</tt></bf> command is the same as
<tt><bf>disable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>deny</bf></tt>.

The options available at the bundle layer are:

<descrip>

<tag><tt>bw-manage</tt></tag>

This command enables <em>bandwidth management</em>, in which mpd attempts
to dynamically adjust the number of connected links depending on the
traffic load.

The proper functioning of bandwidth management depends on the correct
latency and bandwidth information configured for each link; see the
<tt><bf>set link latency</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>set link bandwidth</bf></tt>
commands.

The default for this option is off -- mpd connects the links ``all or none.''

<tag><tt>round-robin</tt></tag>

When multilink PPP is enabled and there are two or more links
connected, this option enables round robin packet scheduling
across the links.  That is, instead of breaking each packet
into fragments and delivering the individual fragments over
all the links in the bundle, each packet is delivered whole
over single link.  The link is chosen by rotating in round-robin
fashion over all the links in the bundle.

This option normally would result in higher latency and
possible delays due to TCP packets being received out of order;
however, it may help in certain situations of high packet
loss or broken peer equipment.

The default is disable.

<tag><tt>ipcp</tt></tag>

Enable/Disable IPCP negotiation. For details see
<ref id="ipcp" name="the IPCP layer chapter">.

The default is enable.

<tag><tt>ipv6cp</tt></tag>

Enable/Disable IPV6CP negotiation.

The default is disable.

<tag><tt>compression</tt></tag>

Enable/Disable CCP (Compression Control Protocol) negotiation. For details see
<ref id="compression" name="the compression layer chapter">.

The default is disable.

<tag><tt>encryption</tt></tag>

Enable/Disable ECP (Encryption Control Protocol) negotiation. For details see
<ref id="encryption" name="the encryption layer chapter">.

The default is disable.

<tag><tt>crypt-reqd</tt></tag>

Require encryption.
When encryption support is compiled into mpd, this option
causes mpd to drop the link if encryption cannot be succesfully
negotiated in both directions. This means in effect, ``use encryption
or don't connect at all.''

The default is disable.
