<p>
A list of open tasks for MPD. This is a good startpoint if you
wan't to support actively the development of MPD. After completing
a task post it to MPD's maling list.

<descrip>

<tag>callback (client & server)</tag>
<p>
Currently MPD supports only simpliest LCP callback without number
negotiation, without CBCP support and only as client.
</p>

<tag>L2TP auth proxying</tag>
<p>
Currently MPD acting as LAC requires parameter renegotiation
on every tunnel hop. It would be good to implement auth proxying
to speedup negotiation.
</p>

<tag>Unimplemented Protocols</tag>
<p>
lcp.c contains a list of protocols (gLcpConfOpts), each protocol with
"false" is not implemented.
