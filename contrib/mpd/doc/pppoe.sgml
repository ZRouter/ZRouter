  <sect><heading>PPPoE device type commands<label id="pppoe"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to PPPoE type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>pppoe</bf>.

  PPPoE requires two pieces of configuration information: the name
  of the Ethernet interface to use, and a service name, which should
  be supplied by your ISP. If you do not have a service name, then
  the empty string (the default) often suffices.

  DSL Forum vendor-specific Circuit-ID/Remote-ID PPPoE tags extraction
  supported in server mode.

<descrip>

<tag><tt>
set pppoe iface <em>interface-name</em>
</tt></tag>

Set the name of the Ethernet interface to use. PPPoE does
not affect normal use of the interface.

<tag><tt>
set pppoe service <em>service-name</em>
</tt></tag>

Sets the requested PPPoE service name. Setting service name to "*" 
on link with allowed incoming connections allows to accept incoming 
connection requests with any service name specified.

Since FreeBSD 6.3-STABLE/7.0-STABLE of 2008-01-30 it is possible to use
"AC-Name\Service-Name" syntax to request specified access concentrator
for outgoing connection.

The default is "*".

<tag><tt>
set pppoe acname <em>name</em>
</tt></tag>

Set name of this PPPoE access concentrator to be sent to clients.
If not specified, local hostname will be used.
