  <p>
  This chapter describes describes some hints for developers.

<descrip>

<tag>Source-Code-Style</tag>
<p>
There is not so much to say about that, just take a look at the existing 
source files. <newline>
The Tab-Width is eight with an indent of fore. Please make a space between 
operators and operands.
</p>

<tag>NgFuncGetStats</tag>
<p>
NEVER call NgFuncGetStats() with the <em>clear</em> parameter set to true, because 
there are other functions (echo requests/replies, bandwidth management) 
wich relies on increasing link-stats. Mpd carries a copy of the netgraph 
link-stats at link-level, just use these instead. You can call 
LinkUpdateStats() for updating the internal stats-struct.
</p>

<tag>New Authentication-Backends</tag>
<p>
Authentication backends must run independently from the rest of Mpd, i.e. 
you must not access any Mpd resource, because 
the authentication process is started in its own thread (you have to 
take care about thread-safety). An <tt>AuthData</tt> object is passed 
to your authenticating function which carries a copy of all required
information. If your backend provides other parameters, like MTU, IP, etc. 
then put these at the appropriate place into <tt>AuthData</tt> or 
<tt>Auth</tt>.

If you can't avoid reading from Mpd's internal data, then acquire the 
Giant Mutex:
<code>
[...]
  pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;gGiantMutex);
  [do whatever]
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;gGiantMutex);
[...]
</code>
</p>
