  <sect><heading>PPTP device type commands<label id="pptp"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to PPTP type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>pptp</bf>.

  The PPTP protocol can be most easily understood as just another
  link layer type, where the link layer medium just happens to be
  an IP connection. So, for example, instead of configuring a
  telephone number to dial as you would with a modem, you configure
  an IP address to connect to. Everything else that's above the
  link layer functions exactly the same. Hence PPTP allows you
  to ``tunnel'' PPP frames over IP.

  Note that PPTP connections are initiated by a TCP connection from
  one machine to another, and that servers usually listen to TCP
  port 1723 (and this is the default for <tt><em>port</em></tt>
  in the commands below). PPTP also uses the GRE protocol, which
  has IP protocol number 47. Your firewall may need to be adjusted
  to allows this type of IP packet.

  Complete PPTP network topology looks like:
<verb>
client <- some link type -> PAC <- PPTP tunnel -> PNS
</verb>

  PAC is physical level repeater, which receives PPP connection of some 
  type and forwards it to PNS using PPTP protocol. PNS is a PPP endpoint, 
  which receives PPP frames via PPTP tunnel and processes them.

  In simple case, when physical conversion is not required, topology 
  can be simplified to:
<verb>
client (PAC emulator) <- PPTP tunnel -> PNS
</verb>

  Mpd is able to operate in both PAC and PNS modes. As PAC mpd supports 
  both simple case PAC emulator and complete PAC topologies. Complete 
  PAC can be configured by joining two physical devices using mpd's
  repeater functionality.

<descrip>

<tag><tt>
set pptp self <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the local IP address and port for the PPTP connection.

<tag><tt>
set pptp peer <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the peer IP address and port for the PPTP connection.
This command applies to both incoming and outgoing connections.
For outgoing connections, this command is required in order to
specify where to connect to. For incoming connections, this command
is optional; if not given, mpd accepts incoming connections from any
host. Otherwise, only connections from the stated IP address
(and, optionally, port) are allowed.

<tag><tt>
set pptp callingnum <em>number</em>
</tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>
set pptp callednum <em>number</em>
</tt></tag>

Sets the calling and called telephone number to use when initiating a PPTP
connection. For most VPN applications this is ignored, but in certain
cases an actual phone number is required.
The default is the empty string.

<tag><tt>set pptp enable <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set pptp disable <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>

Enable and disable PPTP device type options for the link.

</descrip>

<p>
The following options are supported:

<descrip>

<tag><tt>outcall</tt></tag>

In PPTP, each individual PPP connection between two IP hosts (there
may be several, and these are not to be confused with the
<em>single</em> TCP connection between any two IP hosts), is
initiated as either an incoming or an outgoing call. 
This allows to make an outgoing phone call (by PNS) via a remote access
server (PAC), as well as in more common case forward an incoming
phone call from an access server (PAC) to a remote PPTP server (PNS).

When this option is enabled, mpd will initiate outgoing calls (PNS);
otherwise mpd will initiate incoming calls (PAC). Although it seems that
incoming would be more correct, the default is outgoing, as this
is consistent with the behavior of the Microsoft PPTP dial-up adapter
client.

Mpd will accept either type of call on an incoming PPTP connection.

<tag><tt>delayed-ack</tt></tag>

Enable delayed ACK's. This can improve throughput on reliable links.

The default is enable.

<tag><tt>always-ack</tt></tag>

Always include ACK even if already sent. This can improve throughput
on unreliable links.

The default is disable.

<tag><tt>windowing</tt></tag>

Enables the windowing mechanism specified by the protocol. Disabling 
this will cause Mpd to violate the protocol, possibly confusing some 
PPTP peers, but usually results in better performance. The windowing 
mechanism is a design error in the PPTP protocol; L2TP, the successor 
to PPTP, removes it.

the default is disable.

</descrip>

Note that if you are connecting to an NT server, your authentication
name must include the NT domain name. For example:

<tscreen><verb>
    set auth authname "DOMAIN\\username"
</verb></tscreen>
