  <sect><heading>Mpd command line interface<label id="cli"></heading>

<p>
	Mpd provides to user a command line interface on stdin and 
	TCP port. Here mpd commands can be entered to
	configure the various layers and check
	the status of the defined bundles and links.
	The commands available at the command line interface
	are exactly the same ones available in the
	<tt>mpd.conf</tt> config file.

	At any given time, there is always exists an <em>active context</em>
	shich includes active link, bundle and repeater. These name are
	shown in the prompt. Here is an example of running mpd
	with a configuration in <tt>mpd.conf</tt> that defines
	a bundle <tt>myisp</tt> containing two links <tt>modem1</tt>
	and <tt>modem2</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
$ mpd config1
Multi-link PPP daemon for FreeBSD

process 26177 started, version 5.0 (root@orphanage.alkar.net 13:16 22-Sep-2007)
[modem1]
</verb></tscreen>
	By that time, mpd has already read in and executed all 
	the commands associated with the configuration
	<tt>config1</tt>, which defines the bundle <tt>myisp</tt>.
	
	To control mpd runtime you also can connect to mpd's Telnet console.
<tscreen><verb>
> telnet 0 5005

</verb></tscreen>
	
	The prompt <tt>[modem1]</tt> shows the currently active
	link (<tt>modem1</tt>). Any link specific commands issued
	at this point will apply to <tt>modem1</tt>.

	To change the active link, bundle or repeater, use the
	<tt>link</tt>, <tt>bundle</tt> or <tt>repeater</tt> command:
<tscreen><verb>
[modem1] link modem2
[modem2] 
</verb></tscreen>
	Now any commands entered apply to <tt>myisp</tt> or
	<tt>modem2</tt>, as appropriate. This technique works
	the same way in <tt>mpd.conf</tt>. Also, if changing
	the link requires changing bundles as well, mpd will do
	that too.

	The available commands are described in the next chapter.
	When mpd is running, the <tt>help</tt> can be used to
	get more information on a specific command:
<tscreen><verb>
[modem2] help show

Mpd allows you to use only a prefix of a command, as long as the
command is unambigous:
<tscreen><verb>
[modem2] b
