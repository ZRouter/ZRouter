.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a user mode PPP daemon using the
.Xr netgraph 4
networking system.
By using Netgraph,
.Nm
combines the robustness and flexibility of a user-mode PPP implementation
with the speed and reliability of kernel-mode packet forwarding.
All PPP negotiation is handled in user level code, while all data
intensive operations such as encryption, compression, and multi-link
framing are handled strictly in the kernel.
Mpd supports several link layer types, a fully event-driven modem chat
scripting language, and other features.
.Pp
.Nm
creates a
.Xr ng_ppp 4
netgraph node that is placed between a
.Xr ng_iface 4
netgraph interface one or more link layer devices,
performing multi-link PPP negotiation and encapsulation. In multi-link PPP a
.Ar bundle
is a collection of one or more
.Ar links 
between two peers. Each link corresponds to some device (e.g.,
a modem), and each bundle corresponds to one netgraph interface.
The idea is to use all of the links, together connected to a remote
peer also performing multi-link PPP, to utilize their combined
bandwidth.  Packets routed through the netgraph interface travel in
multi-link fragments over all of the links.
Each link is a normal PPP link and can deliver complete packets
as well, so redundancy is another benefit.
Attempts to connect two links in the same bundle to different peers,
or to a peer that is not configured for multi-link PPP, will fail.
.Pp
In general, everything is controlled by executing commands which are either
entered via the console command line or read from a configuration file. If
.Nm
is running as a background daemon, the console can be made accessible via
.Xr telnet 1
Since commands may apply to a single link, the console prompt always shows the
.Ar current bundle
or the
.Ar current link
in that bundle.
