  <sect><heading>Installing mpd<label id="installing"></heading>

  <p>
	If you use the FreeBSD package or port, mpd will be
	automatically installed
	into <tt>/usr/local/sbin/mpd5</tt>.
	with the default set of device types compiled into it.
	In order to run, mpd needs
	a few configuration files. The directory
	<tt>/usr/local/etc/mpd5</tt> is created
	to hold them.
	In it you will find some sample configuration files.
</p>

<p>
	Before you can run mpd, you must set up your site-specific
	configuration files. These files are:
	<descrip>

	<tag> <bf><tt>mpd.conf</tt></bf>

<p>
	This file defines one or more <bf>configurations</bf>.
	When mpd is invoked, you specify the name of a
	configuration on the command line. This configuration
	(which merely consists of a series of mpd commands) is loaded.
	If no configuration is given, 'default' configuration
	is loaded.
</p>

<p>
	Each configuration defines one or more bundles, links and repeaters.
	They can be defined with the <bf><tt>create</tt></bf> command.
	Subsequent commands in the configuration configure the various
	layers for that item.
</p>

	<tag> <bf><tt>mpd.secret</tt></bf>

<p>
	This file contains login, password pairs. This is where
	mpd looks to find all authentication information. This
	file should be readable only by <tt>root</tt>.
</p>

	<tag> <bf><tt>mpd.script</tt></bf>

<p>
	This file contains chat scripts for modem devices.
</p>

	</descrip>
