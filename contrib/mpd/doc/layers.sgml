  <sect><heading>Mpd Layers<label id="layers"></heading>

      <p>
	Mpd consists of several <bf>layers</bf>, corresponding
	to the layered nature of the PPP protocol. There are two
	types of layers hierarchy connected with two different 
	operation modes as "ppp terminator" and "ppp repeater".
	Operation mode is getting chosen dynamically depending on link
	configuration and user auth name (see 'set link action ...' command).
	
	In "ppp terminator" mode such hierarchy used:
	<bf><ref id="interface" name="Interface"></bf> ->
	<bf><ref id="ipcp" name="NCPs"></bf> ->
	<bf><ref id="compression" name="Compression"></bf> ->
	<bf><ref id="encryption" name="Encryption"></bf> ->
	<bf><ref id="bundle" name="Bundle"></bf> -> 
	<bf><ref id="links" name="Links"></bf>
	
	In "ppp repeater" mode different hierarchy used:
	<bf><ref id="links" name="Link1"></bf> ->
	<bf>Repeater</bf> -> 
	<bf><ref id="links" name="Link2"></bf>
	
	A <bf><ref id="links" name="link"></bf> is a single point-to-point
	connection between the local machine and a remote peer machine, 
	implemented by some kind of physical device, 
	such as a serial modem connection or a virtual PPTP connection.
	
	Link parameters include whether authentication is enabled in
	either direction, the authentication type (PAP or CHAP)
	used, keep-alive packets, multilink negotiation options
	and various other link specific parameters.

	Lower half of the link layer is the physical devices layer.
	Configuration of device type specific parameters happens at this layer. 
	Each device has a specific <em>type</em>
	corresponding to one of the supported device types in mpd.
	The type dictates how the device dependent part
	is configured and what it's capabilities are.

	A <bf><ref id="bundle" name="bundle"></bf> is a collection 
	of one or more links, all connecting
	to the same remote peer, that together form a single
	multi-link PPP connection whose effective bandwidth is
	the sum of the bandwidths of the individual links.

	The bundle layer in effect lies just above the link layer.
	The bundle layer handles the task of making multiple 
	physical links appear as a single virtual link.

	At the bundle layer you configure multi-link
	PPP settings and the link management policy. The link management
	policy determines whether mpd tries to keep all the links
	connected all the time, or whether it adds and subtracts
	links depending on demand, and if so, according to what parameters.

	With each bundle is a corresponding 
	<bf><ref id="interface" name="interface"></bf> layer,
	which corresponds directly to a system network interface
	accessible via <tt>ifconfig(8)</tt>, such as <tt>ng0</tt>.
	The interface layer handles configuring the interface,
	bringing it up or down as appropriate, assigning
	IP addresses, setting up static routes and configuring proxy-ARP.
	The interface layer is also responsible for implementing
	Dial-on-Demand and idle timeout functionality.

	Each bundle has several corresponding NCP layers as
	<bf><ref id="ipcp" name="IP Control Protocol (IPCP)"></bf> and
	<bf><ref id="ipv6cp" name="IPv6 Control Protocol (IPv6CP)"></bf>,
	which manages the protocol specific configuration of the interface.
	This layers handle the negotiation of local and remote addresses
	and TCP header compression, as well as other optional 
	IP related information such as DNS servers and NBNS servers.

	Each bundle also has corresponding
	<bf><ref id="compression" name="compression (CCP)"></bf> and
	<bf><ref id="encryption" name="encryption (ECP)"></bf> layers, which
	allow you to enable and configure compression and encryption
	for data sent and received over the bundle.

	A <bf>repeater</bf> is a collection of two physical devices 
	(links). It is getting created when there is need to forward 
	connection coming from one physical device to another without
	modification. This technology is also known as LAC 
	(L2TP Access Concentrator) and PAC (PPTP Access Concentrator).

	While the combination of all the various layers presents
	a large number of configuration options, mpd tries to
	have reasonable defaults for everything.
