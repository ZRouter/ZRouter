<p>
	Mpd is invoked by first setting up your configuration
	files, and then running
<tscreen><tt>
<bf>mpd [ <em>options</em> ] [ <em>configuration</em> ] </bf>
</tt></tscreen>
	On startup mpd run commands from the <tt>startup</tt> label.
	Aftre that, if <tt><em>configuration</em></tt> is supplied,
	mpd looks in <tt>mpd.conf</tt> for a matching label,
	and runs the corresponding commands. If 
	<tt><em>configuration</em></tt> is not supplied,
	mpd looks for the configuration named <tt>default</tt>.

	Mpd can either be run in interactive mode or in the
	background as a daemon. In interactive mode mpd
	accepts commands typed at the console.

	Mpd understands the following command line options.
	Each option has a short, single character form, as
	well as an equivalent long form.

	<descrip>

	<tag><tt>
	-b  --background
	</tt></tag>

	Run as a background daemon.

	<tag><tt>
	-d  --directory <em>dir</em>
	</tt></tag>

	This option allows you to specify a different directory
	for the mpd configuration files other than the default
	<tt>/usr/local/etc/mpd</tt>.

	<tag><tt>
	-f  --file <em>filename</em>
	</tt></tag>

	Specify an initial configuration file other than the default,
	<tt>mpd.conf</tt>.

	<tag><tt>
	-o  --one-shot
	</tt></tag>

	This option forces mpd terminate itself after the last link disappear.
	Link templates are not counted as links.

	<tag><tt>
	-p  --pidfile <em>filename</em>
	</tt></tag>

	Mpd will open and lock <tt><em>filename</em></tt> and
	write its process ID before starting. If another mpd
	process is already running, mpd will not start.
	The default is <tt>/var/run/mpd.pid</tt>.

	<tag><tt>
	-k  --kill
	</tt></tag>

	With this option, pd will attempt to kill any existing mpd
	process before beginning execution. The previous process
	must have written its process ID in the PID file
	<tt>/var/run/mpd.pid</tt> (or the file you specify with
	the <tt>--pidfile</tt> option).

	<tag><tt>
	-s  --syslog-ident <em>ident</em>
	</tt></tag>

	Mpd normally logs via <tt>syslog(3)</tt> with the identifier
	<tt>mpd</tt>. This option allows you to change that identifier.

	<tag><tt>
	-v  --version
	</tt></tag>

	Displays the version number of mpd and exits.

	<tag><tt>
	-h  --help
	</tt></tag>

	Displays a usage message and exits.

	</descrip>

	Mpd responds to the following signals while it is running:

	<descrip>

	<tag>SIGTERM</tag>
	Attempt to gracefully shut down all active connections and exit.

	<tag>SIGUSR1</tag>
	This signal causes mpd to initiate a connection
	with the first link. If mpd is already
	attempting to connect, this signal has no effect.

	<tag>SIGUSR2</tag>
	This signal has the opposite effect, namely, it causes
	mpd to close the first link. If the link
	is already in a closed state, this signal has no effect.

	</descrip>
