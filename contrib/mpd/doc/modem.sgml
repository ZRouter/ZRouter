  <sect><heading>Modem type commands<label id="modem"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to modem type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>modem</bf>.

<descrip>

<tag><tt>
set modem device <em>devname</em>
</tt></tag>

Modem links operate over serial ports. This command tells mpd
which serial port to use for this link, and is required.
The <tt><em>devname</em></tt> should be the pathname of a serial
device, e.g., <tt>/dev/cuad0</tt>.

<tag><tt>
set modem var <em>$variable</em> <em>string</em>
</tt></tag>

Pre-sets the chat script variable <tt><em>$variable</em></tt> to contain
the string <tt><em>string</em></tt>. See <ref id="chat"
name="the chapter on chat scripting"> for more information
on chat variables.

<tag><tt>
set modem speed <em>speed</em>
</tt></tag>

This commands sets the initial serial port speed when opening
the serial device, e.g., 9600, 57600, 115200. Note that you can
always change the serial port speed later from within the chat script.

<tag><tt>
set modem script <em>connect-script</em>
</tt></tag>

This command tells mpd which chat script to run in order to initiate
a PPP connection for this link. The <tt><em>connect-script</em></tt>
should correspond to a label in <tt>mpd.script</tt>. Mpd will jump
to this label after opening the serial port device. If
<tt><em>connect-script</em></tt> is not set, then the chat phase
of the connection is skipped (e.g., if you have a direct null modem
connection).

<tag><tt>
set modem idle-script <em>idle-script</em>
</tt></tag>

This command tells mpd what to do with the serial port when the link is
not connected. If no <tt><em>idle-script</em></tt> is set, then mpd will
leave the serial port closed when not connected. Otherwise, when the
link is disconnected mpd runs the <tt><em>idle-script</em></tt> chat
script. If this script returns <tt>failure</tt>, then mpd
restarts the script.

Otherwise, (i.e., if it returns <tt>success</tt>) mpd examines the
contents of the <tt>$IdleResult</tt> chat variable to decide what to do
next. If it equals
<tt>answer</tt> then mpd will assume that an incoming call has been
answered and immediately enter PPP negotiation. If it equals
<tt>ringback</tt> then mpd will close the serial port, reopen it,
and initiate an outgoing connection normally (i.e., using
<tt><em>connect-script</em></tt>). 

If <tt>$IdleResult</tt> contains anything else or is not set, then
mpd acts as if <tt>failure</tt> had occurred and simply restarts
the script.

<tag><tt>
set modem watch <em>+/-signal ...</em>
</tt></tag>

Mpd normally tracks the carrier detect signal on the serial port
and drops the connection when this signal is lost. You can disable
this behavior with <tt><bf>set modem watch -cd</bf></tt>. Also,
mpd can do the same thing with the DSR signal, though the default
is to ignore DSR. To enable watching of the DSR signal, use
<tt><bf>set modem watch +dsr</bf></tt>.
