* WHAT IS IT?

  A multi-link PPP daemon based on netgraph(4), combining the
  configurability and flexibility of a user-mode with the speed and 
  reliability of a kernel-mode.
  Mpd supports thousands of Sync, Async, PPTP, L2TP, PPPoE, TCP and UDP 
  links in client, server and access concentrator (LAC/PAC) modes.

* HOW STABLE IS IT?

  Most of this code has been thoroughly tested and production ready.

* HOW DO I BUILD AND INSTALL IT?

  cd /usr/ports/net/mpd5
  make all install

* HOW DO I SET IT UP?

  Complete documentation is included in the "doc" subdirectory.

  You will need to create your own versions of the four required
  configuration files in /usr/local/etc/mpd5:

    mpd.conf    - General configuration
    mpd.script  - Modem scripts
    mpd.secret  - Login/password pairs

  If you're familiar with FreeBSD's "ppp" user-mode daemon, the
  configuration method is similar: commands are read from a file.

  Check the "conf" subdirectory for configuration file examples.

  Then append the following lines to /etc/syslog.conf and create an
  empty /var/log/mpd.log file to get proper logging:

    !mpd
    *.*                        /var/log/mpd.log

  Add a corresponding line to /etc/newsyslog.conf as well to get
  proper log rotation.

* WHAT'S THE COPYRIGHT STATUS?

  Berkeley style: see ``COPYRIGHT.iij'' and ``COPYRIGHT.whistle''.

* WHERE CAN I GO FOR HELP?
