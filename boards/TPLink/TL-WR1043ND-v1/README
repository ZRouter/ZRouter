Further work is in progress, for now the kernel boots and the rootfs
mounts.

This was tested with TL-WR1043ND versions 1.1 and 1.8, but I expect all 1.x
should work.

Many thanks to Adrian Chadd and Alexandr Rybalko for the kind help with
this board definition, which is mostly based on Adrian's work on:

How to build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

as root:

env \
	__MAKE_CONF=/dev/null \
	SRCCONF=/dev/null  \
	make \
		FREEBSD_SRC_TREE=/path/to/ZRouter's/FreeBSD/head \
		TARGET_PAIR=TPLink/TL-WR1043ND-v1

Find the TPLink_TL-WR1043ND-v1.bin in /usr/obj/... and copy it to
your TFTP server.

How to flash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

erase 0xbf020000 +7c0000
tftpboot 0x81000000 TPLink_TL-WR1043ND-v1.bin
cp.b 0x81000000 0xbf020000 0x7c0000
bootm 0xbf020000

(hint: you can concatenate the commands by ";")

TODO

* invert LEDs, now `echo 1 > /dev/led/status` switches off
